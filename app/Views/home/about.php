            <p>Hi, I am Nickzad Pratama you can call me Nickzad. I love programming especially web development, I am so lucky because now studying programming is much easier, I can get a lot of information about programming on the internet. Now I can create a website using bootstrap and codeigniter 4. I hope I can give many benefit from my programming skills, for that I must continue to train my skills. besides that I am also good at analysis, I like math and things related to logic, I also like graphic design. I always try to improve my abilities.</p>
